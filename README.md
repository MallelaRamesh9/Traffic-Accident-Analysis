Step 1: Download the Dataset
Visit US Accident Dataset and download the dataset (usually in CSV format).
Step 2: Load and Explore the Data
Step 3: Data Cleaning
Drop columns with too many missing values.
Convert time-related columns to proper datetime format.
Handle missing values in important features.

Step 4: Identify Patterns in Accidents
1. Accidents by Time of Day
2. Accidents by Weather Condition
3. Accidents by Road Condition
Step 5: Visualize Accident Hotspots on a Map
Step 6: Further Analysis
Identify peak accident months
Compare accidents on weekdays vs. weekends
Analyze the impact of rain, snow, and fog on accidents
Next Steps
Apply Machine Learning Models to predict accident severity.
Use clustering techniques (K-Means) to group accident-prone locations.
Build an interactive dashboard using Dash or Streamlit.
